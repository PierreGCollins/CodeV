Creating DLLs from a C source file:

1. Install utility tools

Download and install MinGW: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html. For me, setp 10 did not work. A simple workaround is to open the command prompt (type CMD on the Windows entry) and copy the following (correct the path if you did not install MinGW directly in C:\):
  set PATH=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;%Path%
  set PATH=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;%Path%
